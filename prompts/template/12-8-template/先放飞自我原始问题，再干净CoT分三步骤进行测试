To answer this question, we need to calculate the interest earned for both scenarios and then compare the difference.

Scenario 1: Deposit started in August 2022
Interest rate: 0.0315 (annual)

Scenario 2: Deposit started in January 2023
Interest rate: 0.0285 (annual)

First, let's calculate the interest earned for each scenario.

Scenario 1:
Number of years: 3
Interest rate: 0.0315
Principal: $100,000

Interest earned = Principal * Interest rate * Number of years
Interest earned = $100,000 * 0.0315 * 3
Interest earned = $9,455

Scenario 2:
Number of years: 3
Interest rate: 0.0285
Principal: $100,000

Interest earned = Principal * Interest rate * Number of years
Interest earned = $100,000 * 0.0285 * 3
Interest earned = $8,595

Now, let's calculate the difference in interest earned between the two scenarios.

Difference in interest earned = Interest earned (Scenario 1) - Interest earned (Scenario 2)
Difference in interest earned = $9,455 - $8,595
Difference in interest earned = $860

So, Mr. Wang will earn $860 less interest if he starts the deposit in January 2023 compared to starting in August 2022.
