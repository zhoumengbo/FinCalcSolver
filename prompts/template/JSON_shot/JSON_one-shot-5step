Your task is to solve financial calculation problems that are delimited by three double quotes. The output format should be consistent with the Structured Answer Instructions and Examples provided. The content of your output should align with the text delimited by three single quotes.

First, I will outline the structured answer instructions and format. This will establish a clear guideline for formulating structured answers. Following these foundational instructions, I will present two sample questions and demonstrate their structured solutions, applying the outlined instructions for clarity and precision. Please adhere to these instructions for a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the calculation process. Ensure that each variable name is unique across all sections to avoid confusion. Distinctly name input variables, intermediate variables, and target variables, especially if they represent different concepts or stages in the calculation. Ensure to append the unit of measurement to each variable description. Ensure to distinguish between currency units when appending them to variable descriptions, for example, use (yuan) for yuan and ($) for dollars.

Structured Answer Instruction:
{
  "1. Define Input Variable(s)": {
    "Instruction": "List each numerical detail explicitly mentioned in the question as a unique variable. Focus exclusively on the numbers given in the question, without including inferred or calculated values. This approach is essential for laying the groundwork for the calculation process, ensuring that all relevant numerical data are systematically defined and ready for use. Avoid including inferred or calculated values at this stage; limit the scope strictly to the numerical details as they are presented."
  },
  "2. Input Variable(s) Assignment": {
    "Instruction": "Precisely assign the actual numerical values to the input variables identified in the first step. This involves directly transferring the quantitative data from the question to the respective variables, ensuring accuracy in the values being used as the basis for calculations. At this stage, only direct value assignments should be made, without performing any form of calculation. Avoid the use of any calculation symbols (such as plus, minus, multiply, divide)."
  },
  "3. Define Intermediate Variable(s)": {
    "Instruction": "Enumerate any variables that are crucial for bridging between the initial input data and the final output, but are not explicitly mentioned in the question. Assumptions some intermediate variables can be made if necessary. These intermediate variables are instrumental in the step-by-step breakdown of the calculation and should be clearly distinguished from both the input and target variables."
  },
  "4. Define Target Variable(s)": {
    "Instruction": "Clearly identify the final or target variable(s) that the calculation seeks to solve for or compute. These target variables represent the end goal of the calculation process and are derived from the combination of input and intermediate variables. Defining the target variables sets a clear objective for what the calculation will arrive at. The target variables should not include those variables whose numerical values can already be extracted from the question description and assigned to them(i.e. for these variables it is better to define them as input variables)."
  },
  "5. List the equation(s) that include all defined variables": {
    "Instruction": "Develop equations eventually leading to solve for the target variables(s). To do that, we first develop a system of equations involving all variables and then we will solve for the target variables. Each equation should be clearly structured, integrating all relevant variables from the initial definitions. This step ensures a coherent progression from the input data to the final outcome, highlighting the integration of all variables into the calculation process."
  }
}

Note:
Your answer must strictly conform to the JSON structure outlined in the template. Offer a clear, methodical, and accurate representation of the calculation process, following the question's parameters closely. Explicitly avoid using any specific numerical values for the calculations. There must be no redundant information other than the output in JSON format.


Sample Question:
Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?

Structured Answer:
{
  "1. Define Input Variable(s)": {
    "Olivia's initial money ($)": "O",
    "Cost of each bagel ($)": "B",
    "Number of bagels": "N"
  },
  "2. Input Variable(s) Assignment": {
    "O": 23,
    "B": 3,
    "N": 5
  },
  "3. Define Intermediate Variable(s)": {
    "Total cost ($)": "T"
  },
  "4. Define Target Variable(s)": {
    "Remaining money ($)": "R"
  },
  "5. List the equation(s) that include all defined variables": {
    "eq1": "T = N * B",
    "eq2": "O = T + R"
  }
}
