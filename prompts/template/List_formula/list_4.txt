### INSTRUCTION ###
Your task is to solve financial calculation problems that are delimited by three double quotes. The output format should be consistent with the Structured Answer Instructions and Examples provided. The content of your output should align with the text delimited by three single quotes.
First, I will outline the structured answer instructions and format. This will establish a clear guideline for formulating structured answers. Following these foundational instructions, I will present two sample questions and demonstrate their structured solutions, applying the outlined instructions for clarity and precision. Please adhere to these instructions for a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the calculation process. Ensure that each variable name is unique across all sections to avoid confusion. Distinctly name input variables and target variables, especially if they represent different concepts or stages in the calculation. Ensure to append the unit of measurement to each variable description. Ensure to distinguish between currency units when appending them to variable descriptions, for example, use (yuan) for yuan and ($) for dollars.

### Structured Answer Instruction ###
{
  "1. Define Input Variable(s)": {
    "Instruction": "List each numerical detail explicitly mentioned in the question as a unique variable. Focus exclusively on the numbers given in the question, without including inferred or calculated values. This approach is essential for laying the groundwork for the calculation process, ensuring that all relevant numerical data are systematically defined and ready for use. Avoid including inferred or calculated values at this stage; limit the scope strictly to the numerical details as they are presented."
  },
  "2. Input Variable(s) Assignment": {
    "Instruction": "Precisely assign the actual numerical values to the input variables identified in the first step. This involves directly transferring the quantitative data from the question to the respective variables, ensuring accuracy in the values being used as the basis for calculations. At this stage, only direct value assignments should be made, without performing any form of calculation. Avoid the use of any calculation symbols (such as plus, minus, multiply, divide)."
  },
  "3. Define Target Variable(s)": {
    "Instruction": "Clearly identify the final or target variable(s) that the calculation seeks to solve for or compute. These target variables represent the end goal of the calculation process and are derived from the combination of input and intermediate variables. Defining the target variables sets a clear objective for what the calculation will arrive at. The target variables should not include those variables whose numerical values can already be extracted from the question description and assigned to them(i.e. for these variables it is better to define them as input variables)."
  }
}

Note:
Your answer must strictly conform to the JSON structure outlined in the template. Explicitly avoid using any numbers and formulas for calculation and reasoning. There must be no redundant information other than the output in JSON format.

### Sample Question ###
Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?

### Structured Answer ###
{
  "1. Define Input Variable(s)": {
    "Olivia's initial money ($)": "O",
    "Cost of each bagel ($)": "B",
    "Number of bagels": "N"
  },
  "2. Input Variable(s) Assignment": {
    "O": 23,
    "B": 3,
    "N": 5
  },
  "3. Define Target Variable(s)": {
    "Remaining money ($)": "R"
  }
}

### INPUT DATA ###
```
Question: Jindi Company's 2015 income statement shows sales revenue of 8 million yuan, with net profit being 0.08 of sales revenue. The balance sheet shows current assets of 2 million yuan, fixed assets of 6 million yuan, net working capital of 1 million yuan, and long-term liabilities of 3 million yuan. Please calculate the Return on Equity (ROE). Please do not use the DuPont formula.
