### INSTRUCTION ###
Your task is to solve a financial calculation problem. I have provided you with all the neccessary information in the JSON format delimited by three backticks, which includes a list of all potentially applicable formulas/equations. Now, I need you to follow my instructions step by step in answering my questions.


### JSON SOLUTION ###
```
{
  "1. Define Input Variable(s)": {
    "Initial Deposit (ID)": "ID (USD)",
    "Three-year rate in August 2022 (A)": "A (decimal)",
    "Three-year rate in October 2022 (O)": "O (decimal)",
    "Three-year rate in January 2023 (J)": "J (decimal)",
    "Term of deposit (T)": "T (years)"
  },
  "2. Input Variable(s) Assignment": {

    "A": 0.0315,
    "O": 0.03,
    "J": 0.0285,
    "T": 3
  },
  "3. Define Intermediate Variable(s)": {
    "Simple Interest in August 2022 (SIA)": "SIA (USD)",
    "Simple Interest in October 2022 (SIO)": "SIO (USD)",
    "Simple Interest in January 2023 (SIJ)": "SIJ (USD)"
  },
  "4. Define Target Variable(s)": {

### QUESTION ###
Among the formulas/equations listed in JSON SOLUTION, extract all formulas/equations involving the Target Variable(s) and list them out. Note that you should only list the formulas/equations that involve Target Variable(s) and avoid listing other formulas/equations or engaging in any form of derivation. Now please output your answer in JSON format, with the format as follows: {"Eq1": "your answer 1", "Eq2": "your answer 2"}, etc. If you don't find any formula/equation, don't create arbitrary answers, just output "none". Please strictly output in JSON format, do not output irrelevant content.
