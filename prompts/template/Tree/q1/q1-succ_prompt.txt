Below is a question about financial calculation.
Question: To stimulate economic growth, since 2022, the country has repeatedly lowered bank deposit interest rates. The three-year rate was 0.0315 in August 2022, reduced to 0.03 in October, and further to 0.0285 in January 2023. These rates are simple annual interest rates. In January 2023, if Mr. Wang has a deposit of $100,000 for a fixed term of three years (note that this is a fixed-term deposit for three years), how much less interest will he earn compared to a similar three-year term deposit that if he had started in August 2022? Please use simple interest in your calculations, and do not use exponential or continuous compounding.

Please only list Target Variable(s) and use abbreviations to represent each variable. Please remember these Target Variable(s), later we will use them. Instruction: Clearly identify the final variable(s) that the calculation seeks to resolve. These target variables represent the end goal of the calculation process and are derived from the combination of input and intermediate variables. Defining the target variables sets a clear objective for what the calculation will ascertain. Do not to engage in any form of calculation. Note that only list target variable(s). There must be no redundant information other than the target variable(s).

These Target Variables represent the end goal of the calculation process and are derived from the combination of input and intermediate variables.

###2 （当前使用）(好像更好一些，因为下面的table格式会自动做运算，算出一些值，比如会把NP=0.08*SR直接算出来，放到表里。但是我们不信任LLM做推导和运算，所以应该避免）
Identify all the numerical values in the question, including implicit numerical values such as "three-month," "three months," "five-inch," "five inches," etc. And convert "1 million" or "one million" into 1,000,000, etc. However, do not include numerical values that require derivation and calculation. In the following, we will assign variable names to these numerical values. Please remember these variables as "Input Variable(s)" as a whole, later we will refer to these "Input Variable(s)".
For each numerical value identified above, perform the following tasks:
1. In accordance with the context of the question and following financial industry conventions, for this numerical value, create a new variable and define its variable name in an English abbreviation form that conforms to financial industry standards.
2. Assign the numerical value(note:only numbers, no formulas or equations or other variables) to this variable.
3. Based on the context of the question, provide a financial interpretation for this variable.
4. Extract the unit of the numerical value.
5. Present the financial interpretation, variable name, unit, and numerical value in a structured format in list form.

In accordance with the context of the question and following financial industry conventions, for this numerical value, create a new variable and define its variable name in an English acronym form that conforms to financial industry standards and Finance common practice(note: acronym form is MUST, i.e. use "FV" for "Face Value", etc.).
2. Assign the numerical value(note:only numbers, no formulas or equations or other variables) to this variable.
3. Based on the context of the question, provide a financial interpretation for this variable.
4. Extract the unit of the numerical value.

You are a finance expert. Do the following tasks:
For each variable in Input Variable(s) and Target Variable(s), perform the following steps:
1. List all formulas/equations in Finance involving the-said variable (note: list all formulas/equations involving this variable. If a variable does not involve any formulas/equations, do not list it arbitrarily).
2. According to our specific question, apply the above-listed formulas/equations to our specific question(note: don't substitute numerical values into formulas/equations). Create necessary but non-overlapping Intermediate Variables (note: Intermediate Variables should not overlap with any of those Target Variables or Input Variables) according to the question and Finance common practice.

You are a Finance expert. Put all variables in the Input Variables into a new set A. Then put all variables in the Target Variables into the set A. Then put all variables in the Intermediate Variables into the set A. Note: ignore the origins of the variables when putting them into the set A. Manually enumerate all possible combinations of two elements from this set. Do not use any programming language or code to generate these combinations. Instead, list each possible pair of elements from set A, ensuring that each combination is unique and no pair is repeated. Provide a complete list of these two-element combinations.

Note: if a percentage number had already been converted into a decimal number, use 'decimal' instead of '%' as its unit.
For example, if you use '0.05' to represent '5%', then use 'decimal' instead of '%' as the unit of 0.05 or its defined variable.
