Then apply the above-listed general formulas/equations to our specific question(note: don't substitute numerical values into formulas/equations). Define necessary but non-duplicating Intermediate Variables (note: Intermediate Variables should not duplicate with any of those Target Variables or Input Variables) according to Finance common practice. Based on the context of the specific question, provide a specific interpretation for the formulas/equations in the context of our specific question. Let's call it 'Interpretation Specific to our Question for Formulas'.

Input Variable(s):

a. Bond_term:
- Interpretation Specific to our Question for Variable: The duration of the 5-year government bond
- Interpretation Specific to our Question for Formulas:
  - Bond_term = 5

b. Face_value:
- Interpretation Specific to our Question for Variable: The initial principal amount of the 1000 yuan bond
- Interpretation Specific to our Question for Formulas:
  - Future_value = Face_value * (1 + Interest_rate)^Time_to_maturity

c. Coupon_rate:
- Interpretation Specific to our Question for Variable: The annual interest rate of 0.12 paid on the bond
- Interpretation Specific to our Question for Formulas:
  - Coupon_payment = Face_value * Coupon_rate

d. Discount_rate:
- Interpretation Specific to our Question for Variable: The annual interest rate of 0.1 used to discount future cash flows
- Interpretation Specific to our Question for Formulas:
  - Present_value = Future_value / (1 + Discount_rate)^Time_to_maturity

Target Variable(s):

a. Present_Value:
- Interpretation Specific to our Question for Variable: The present value of the 5-year government bond, considering the time value of money and the risk-free interest rate, given the face value, annual coupon rate, and annual discount rate.
- Interpretation Specific to our Question for Formulas:
  - Present_value = Face_value * (1 + Discount_rate)^(-Bond_term) + Coupon_payment * (1 + Discount_rate)^(-Bond_term) * (1 - (1 + Discount_rate)^(-Bond_term)) / Discount_rat<|im_end|>


4. For each variable in the Intermediate Variables, list all formulas/equations in Finance which involve the-said variable (note: list all formulas/equations involving this variable). According to our specific question, apply the above-listed formulas/equations to our specific question(note: don't substitute numerical values into formulas/equations). Define necessary but non-overlapping Intermediate Variables (note: Intermediate Variables should not overlap with any of those Target Variables or Input Variables) according to Finance common practice.

Intermediate Variable(s):

a. Time_to_maturity:
- General Financial Interpretation for Variable: The duration of the bond, in years
- General Financial Interpretation for Formulas:
  - Time_to_maturity = Bond_term

b. Interest_rate:
- General Financial Interpretation for Variable: The annual interest rate paid on the bond
- General Financial Interpretation for Formulas:
  - Coupon_payment = Face_value * Interest_rate

c. Future_value:
- General Financial Interpretation for Variable: The future value of an investment or financial instrument, considering the time value of money and the risk-free interest rate
- General Financial Interpretation for Formulas:
  - Future_value = Face_value * (1 + Interest_rate)^Time_to_maturity

d. Coupon_payment:
- General Financial Interpretation for Variable: The annual interest payment received by the bondholder
- General Financial Interpretation for Formulas:
  - Coupon_payment = Face_value * Coupon_rate

e. Discount_rate:
- General Financial Interpretation for Variable: The annual interest rate used to discount future cash flows
- General Financial Interpretation for Formulas:
  - Present_value = Future_value / (1 + Discount_rate)^Time_to_maturity



 1. For the combination (Present_Value, Coupon_rate), the formula/equation in Finance involving these two variables is:
