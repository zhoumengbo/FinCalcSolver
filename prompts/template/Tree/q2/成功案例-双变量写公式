Given the above 'Two-Element Combinations' table, for each of these two-element combinations, represented as (a, b), perform the following steps:
1. List all formulas/equations in Finance involving the-said two variables a and b (note: list all formulas/equations involving the two variables. If the two variables do not involve any formulas/equations, do not list it arbitrarily).
2. According to our specific question in the [Question] section delimited by three backticks, apply the above-listed formulas/equations to our specific question(note: don't substitute numerical values into formulas/equations). Create necessary but non-duplicating Intermediate Variables (note: Intermediate Variables should not  with any of those Target Variables or Input Variables) according to the question and Finance common practice.

```[Question]
Question: There is a 5-year government bond with a face value of 1000 yuan, an annual coupon rate of 0.12. And the interests are compounded(using the annual coupon rate 0.12) annually but not physically paid out to the investor until maturity. Instead, these interests are accrued and recorded and added to the previous compounding basis to form the new basis for compounding(using the annual coupon rate 0.12 to compound) the next year. That's to say, in year 0, the compounding basis is 1000 yuan, then in year 1, the compounding basis becomes 1000*(1+0.12)^1 yuan, in year 2, the compounding basis becomes 1000*(1+0.12)^2 yuan, ... so on and so forth. Then all the accrued interests are paid out at maturity in a lump-sum payment, together with the repayment of the principal. That's to say, both the principal and accrued interests are physically paid out to the investor in a single lump-sum payment at maturity. Assuming an annual discount rate of 0.1, what is its present value?

##### Answer #####:

1. List all formulas/equations in Finance involving the said two variables a and b:

For the given question, the two variables are FV (Face Value) and ACR (Annual Coupon Rate).

Formula/Equation:

1. Future Value (FV) of an investment with compound interest: FV = PV * (1 + r)^n, where PV is the present value, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years.

2. Present Value (PV) of an investment with compound interest: PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where FV is the future value, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years.

3. Present Value of an Annuity (PVA) with compound interest: PVA = PMT * [(1 + r)^n - 1] / r, where PMT is the periodic payment, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years.

4. Future Value of an Annuity (FVA) with compound interest: FVA = PMT * [(1 + r)^n * (1 + r)^n - 1] / (r * (1 + r)^n), where PMT is the periodic payment, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years.

5. Present Value of a Lump-Sum Payment (PVL) with discounting: PVL = FV / (1 + r)^n, where FV is the future value, r is the annual discount rate, and n is the number of years.

6. Future Value of a Lump-Sum Payment (FVL) with compounding: FVL = PV * (1 + r)^n, where PV is the present value, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years.

2. Apply the above-listed formulas/equations to our specific question:

Given:

- Face Value (FV) = 1000 yuan
- Annual Coupon Rate (ACR) = 0.12
- Annual Discount Rate (ADR) = 0.1
- Number of years (n) = 5

We need to find the Present Value (PV) of the investment.

Step 1: Calculate the Future Value (FV) of the investment using the given ACR and n.

FV = 1000 * (1 + 0.12)^5 = 1000 * (1.12)^5 ≈ 1610.56 yuan

Step 2: Calculate the Present Value (PV) of the investment using the given ADR and n.

PV = FV / (1 + ADR)^n = 1610.56 / (1 + 0.1)^5 ≈ 1000 yuan

So, the Present Value (PV) of the investment is approximately 1000 yuan.
