Below is a question about financial calculation.
Question: There is a 5-year government bond with a face value of 1000 yuan, an annual coupon rate of 0.12. And the interests are compounded(using the annual coupon rate 0.12) annually but not physically paid out to the investor until maturity. Instead, these interests are accrued and recorded and added to the compounding basis to become the new basis for compounding(using the annual coupon rate 0.12 to compound) the next year. Then all the accrued interests are paid out at maturity in a lump-sum payment, together with the repayment of the principal. That's to say, both the principal and accrued interests are physically paid out to the investor in a single lump-sum payment at maturity. Assuming an annual discount rate of 0.1, what is its present value?

Now I want to solve for the Present Value of Bond with Accrued Interest and Future Value (PVBAFV), please help me solve this problem.<|im_end|>

##### Answer #####:
 To solve for the Present Value of Bond with Accrued Interest and Future Value (PVBAFV), we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the annual interest payment (coupon payment)
2. Calculate the future value of the bond at maturity
3. Calculate the present value of the bond with accrued interest

Step 1: Calculate the annual interest payment (coupon payment)
The annual coupon rate is 0.12, and the face value of the bond is 1000 yuan.
Annual interest payment = Face value * Annual coupon rate
Annual interest payment = 1000 * 0.12
Annual interest payment = 120 yuan

Step 2: Calculate the future value of the bond at maturity
The bond has a maturity of 5 years, and the annual interest payment is 120 yuan.
Future value = Annual interest payment * (1 + Annual discount rate)^Number of years
Future value = 120 * (1 + 0.1)^5
Future value = 120 * 1.1^5
Future value = 120 * 1.610512
Future value = 193.26144

Step 3: Calculate the present value of the bond with accrued interest
Since the interests are compounded annually and not physically paid out until maturity, we need to find the present value of the bond with accrued interest.
Present value with accrued interest = Future value / (1 + Annual discount rate)^Number of years
Present value with accrued interest = 193.26144 / (1 + 0.1)^5
Present value with accrued interest = 193.26144 / 1.610512
Present value with accrued interest = 120

So, the Present Value of Bond with Accrued Interest and Future Value (PVBAFV) is 120 yuan.

##### Answer #####:
 To solve for the present value of the 5-year government bond, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the annual interest payment using the annual coupon rate.
2. Calculate the future value of the bond at maturity using the annual coupon rate and the annual discount rate.
3. Calculate the present value of the bond using the future value and the annual discount rate.

Step 1: Calculate the annual interest payment
Annual interest payment = Face value * Annual coupon rate
Annual interest payment = 1000 * 0.12
Annual interest payment = 120 yuan

Step 2: Calculate the future value of the bond at maturity
Future value = Face value * (1 + Annual coupon rate)^Number of years
Future value = 1000 * (1 + 0.12)^5
Future value = 1000 * (1.12)^5
Future value = 1000 * 1.6384
Future value = 1638.4 yuan

Step 3: Calculate the present value of the bond
Present value = Future value / (1 + Annual discount rate)^Number of years
Present value = 1638.4 / (1 + 0.1)^5
Present value = 1638.4 / 1.1^5
Present value = 1638.4 / 1.610512
Present value â‰ˆ 1013.9 yuan

So, the present value of the 5-year government bond is approximately 1013.9 yuan.
