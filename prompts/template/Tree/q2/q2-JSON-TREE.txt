### INSTRUCTION ###
Your task is to solve a financial calculation problem. I have provided you with all the neccessary information in the JSON format delimited by three backticks, which includes a list of all potentially applicable formulas/equations. Now, I need you to follow my instructions step by step in answering my questions.

### QUESTION ###
Among the formulas/equations listed in JSON SOLUTION, extract all formulas/equations involving the Target Variable(s) and list them out. Note that you should only list the formulas/equations that involve Target Variable(s) and avoid listing other formulas/equations or engaging in any form of derivation. Now please output your answer in JSON format, with the format as follows: {"Eq1": "your answer 1", "Eq2": "your answer 2"}, etc. If you don't find any formula/equation, don't create arbitrary answers, just output "none". Please strictly output in JSON format, do not output irrelevant content.



According to our specific question, what does "PV = FV / (1 + r)^n"  mean?
What does "FV" mean here?
What does "r" mean here?
What does "n" mean here?
