Below is a question about financial calculation.
Question: There is a 5-year government bond with a face value of 1000 yuan, an annual coupon rate of 0.12. And the interests are compounded(using the annual coupon rate 0.12) annually but not physically paid out to the investor until maturity. Instead, these interests are accrued and recorded and added to the previous compounding basis to form the new basis for compounding(using the annual coupon rate 0.12 to compound) the next year. That's to say, in year 0, the compounding basis is 1000 yuan, then in year 1, the compounding basis becomes 1000*(1+0.12)^1 yuan, in year 2, the compounding basis becomes 1000*(1+0.12)^2 yuan, ... so on and so forth. Then all the accrued interests are paid out at maturity in a lump-sum payment, together with the repayment of the principal. That's to say, both the principal and accrued interests are physically paid out to the investor in a single lump-sum payment at maturity. Assuming an annual discount rate of 0.1, what is its present value?

Please only list Target Variable(s) and define its variable name based on the financial terminology, ensuring that each variable name accurately reflects the financial concept it represents. Use underscores to connect words within each variable name. For example, if the financial term is 'Interest Rate', then the variable name should be 'Interest_rate'. Please remember these Target Variable(s), later we will use them. Instruction: Clearly identify the final variable(s) that the calculation seeks to resolve. These target variables represent the end goal of the calculation process and are derived from the combination of input and intermediate variables. Defining the target variables sets a clear objective for what the calculation will ascertain. Do not to engage in any form of calculation. Note that only list target variable(s). There must be no redundant information other than the target variable(s).

Below is a question about financial calculation.
Question: To stimulate economic growth, since 2022, the country has repeatedly lowered bank deposit interest rates. The three-year rate was 0.0315 in August 2022, reduced to 0.03 in October, and further to 0.0285 in January 2023. These rates are simple annual interest rates. In January 2023, if Mr. Wang has a deposit of $100,000 for a fixed term of three years (note that this is a fixed-term deposit for three years), how much less interest will he earn compared to a similar three-year term deposit that if he had started in August 2022? Please use simple interest in your calculations, and do not use exponential or continuous compounding.

Please identify the Target Variable(s) and use Finance common practice abbreviations following financial industry conventions to represent each variable. Instruction: Clearly identify the final variable(s) that the calculation seeks to resolve. These Target Variables represent the end goal of the calculation process and are derived from the combination of input and intermediate variables. Defining the target variables sets a clear objective for what the calculation will ascertain. Do not to engage in any form of calculation. Note that only list Target Variable(s). There must be no redundant information other than the Target Variable(s).


###2  提取输入变量（当前使用）(好像更好一些，因为下面的table格式会自动做运算，算出一些值，比如会把NP=0.08*SR直接算出来，放到表里。但是我们不信任LLM做推导和运算，所以应该避免）
Identify all the numerical values in the question, including implicit numerical values such as "three-month," "three months," "five-inch," "five inches," etc. And convert "1 million" or "one million" into 1,000,000, etc. However, do not include numerical values that require derivation and calculation. In the following, we will assign variable names to these numerical values. Please remember these variables as "Input Variable(s)" as a whole, later we will refer to these "Input Variable(s)".
For each numerical value identified above, perform the following tasks:
1. In accordance with the context of the question and following financial industry conventions, for this numerical value, create a new variable and define its variable name based on the financial terminology, ensuring that each variable name accurately reflects the financial concept it represents. Use underscores to connect words within each variable name. For example, if the financial term is 'Interest Rate', then the variable name should be 'Interest_rate'.
2. Assign the numerical value(note:only numbers, no formulas or equations or other variables) to this variable.
3. Based on the context of the question, provide a financial interpretation for this variable.
4. Extract the unit of the numerical value.
5. Present the financial interpretation, variable name, unit, and numerical value in a structured format in list form.

```[Question]
Question: There is a 5-year government bond with a face value of 1000 yuan, an annual coupon rate of 0.12. And the interests are compounded(using the annual coupon rate 0.12) annually but not physically paid out to the investor until maturity. Instead, these interests are accrued and recorded and added to the previous compounding basis to form the new basis for compounding(using the annual coupon rate 0.12 to compound) the next year. That's to say, in year 0, the compounding basis is 1000 yuan, then in year 1, the compounding basis becomes 1000*(1+0.12)^1 yuan, in year 2, the compounding basis becomes 1000*(1+0.12)^2 yuan, ... so on and so forth. Then all the accrued interests are paid out at maturity in a lump-sum payment, together with the repayment of the principal. That's to say, both the principal and accrued interests are physically paid out to the investor in a single lump-sum payment at maturity. Assuming an annual discount rate of 0.1, what is its present value?
