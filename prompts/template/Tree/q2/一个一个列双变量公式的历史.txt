Below is a question about financial calculation.
Question: There is a 5-year government bond with a face value of 1000 yuan, an annual coupon rate of 0.12. And the interests are compounded(using the annual coupon rate 0.12) annually but not physically paid out to the investor until maturity. Instead, these interests are accrued and recorded and added to the compounding basis to become the new basis for compounding(using the annual coupon rate 0.12 to compound) the next year. Then all the accrued interests are paid out at maturity in a lump-sum payment, together with the repayment of the principal. That's to say, both the principal and accrued interests are physically paid out to the investor in a single lump-sum payment at maturity. Assuming an annual discount rate of 0.1, what is its present value?

Please only list Target Variable(s) and use abbreviations to represent each variable. Please remember these Target Variable(s), later we will use them. Instruction: Clearly identify the final variable(s) that the calculation seeks to resolve. These target variables represent the end goal of the calculation process and are derived from the combination of input and intermediate variables. Defining the target variables sets a clear objective for what the calculation will ascertain. Do not to engage in any form of calculation. Note that only list target variable(s). There must be no redundant information other than the target variable(s).<|im_end|>

Identify all the numerical values in the question, including implicit numerical values such as "three-month," "three months," "five-inch," "five inches," etc. And convert "1 million" or "one million" into 1,000,000, etc. However, do not include numerical values that require derivation and calculation. In the following, we will assign variable names to these numerical values. Please remember these variables as "Input Variable(s)" as a whole, later we will refer to these "Input Variable(s)".
For each numerical value identified above, perform the following tasks:
1. In accordance with the context of the question and following financial industry conventions, for this numerical value, create a new variable and define its variable name in an English abbreviation form that conforms to financial industry standards.
2. Assign the numerical value(note:only numbers, no formulas or equations or other variables) to this variable.
3. Based on the context of the question, provide a financial interpretation for this variable.
4. Extract the unit of the numerical value.
5. Present the financial interpretation, variable name, unit, and numerical value in a structured format in list form.<|im_end|>

You are a Finance expert. Put all variables in the Input Variables into a new set A. Then put all variables in the Target Variables into the set A. Then put all variables in the Intermediate Variables into the set A. Note: ignore the origins of the variables when putting them into the set A. Manually enumerate all possible combinations of two elements from this set. Do not use any programming language or code to generate these combinations. Instead, list each possible pair of elements from set A, ensuring that each combination is unique and no pair is repeated. Provide a complete list of these two-element combinations.<|im_end|>
