Below is a question about financial calculation.
Question: There is a 5-year government bond with a face value of 1000 yuan, an annual coupon rate of 0.12. And the interests are compounded(using the annual coupon rate 0.12) annually but not physically paid out to the investor until maturity. Instead, these interests are accrued and recorded and added to the compounding basis to become the new basis for compounding(using the annual coupon rate 0.12 to compound) the next year. Then all the accrued interests are paid out at maturity in a lump-sum payment, together with the repayment of the principal. That's to say, both the principal and accrued interests are physically paid out to the investor in a single lump-sum payment at maturity. Assuming an annual discount rate of 0.1, what is its present value?

 Input Variables:
 - Face Value (FV): 1000 yuan
 - Annual Coupon Rate (ACR): 0.12
 - Annual Discount Rate (ADR): 0.1
 - Compounding Frequency: 1 (annually)
 - Maturity: 5 years

 Target Variables:
 - Present Value (PV)

 Intermediate Variables:
 - Annual Discount Factor (ADF)
 - Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
 - Future Value (FV_n)
 - Accrued Interests (AI)
 - Total Amount Paid at Maturity

For the following two-element combination (FV, ACR), perform the following steps:
1. List all formulas/equations in Finance involving the-said variable FV and ACR. For each formula/equation, write out explictly its complete form(note: list all formulas/equations involving the two variables. If the two variables do not involve any formulas/equations, do not list it arbitrarily).
2. According to our specific question, apply the above-listed formulas/equations to our specific question(note: don't substitute numerical values into formulas/equations). Create necessary but non-overlapping Intermediate Variables (note: Intermediate Variables should not overlap with any of those Target Variables or Input Variables) according to the question and Finance common practice.
