Target Variable(s):

a. Present_Value:

Given the specific question:

Question: There is a 5-year government bond with a face value of 1000 yuan, an annual coupon rate of 0.12. And the interests are compounded(using the annual coupon rate 0.12) annually but not physically paid out to the investor until maturity. Instead, these interests are accrued and recorded and added to the previous compounding basis to form the new basis for compounding(using the annual coupon rate 0.12 to compound) the next year. That's to say, in year 0, the compounding basis is 1000 yuan, then in year 1, the compounding basis becomes 1000*(1+0.12)^1 yuan, in year 2, the compounding basis becomes 1000*(1+0.12)^2 yuan, ... so on and so forth. Then all the accrued interests are paid out at maturity in a lump-sum payment, together with the repayment of the principal. That's to say, both the principal and accrued interests are physically paid out to the investor in a single lump-sum payment at maturity. Assuming an annual discount rate of 0.1, what is its present value?

Applying the formulas/equations to the specific question:

1. (Present_Value, Coupon_rate)

- Coupon rate formula: Coupon rate = (Annual coupon payment / Face value) * 100
  - Annual coupon payment = Face value * Coupon rate
  - Coupon rate = 0.12
  - Annual coupon payment = 1000 * 0.12 = 120 yuan

2. (Present_Value, Future_value)

- Future Value of an Annuity Due (FVAD) formula: FVAD = FV * (1 + r)^n
  - FV = Face value + (Annual coupon payment * Number of years)
  - FV = 1000 + (120 * 5) = 1000 + 600 = 1600 yuan
  - FVAD = 1600 * (1 + 0.1)^5 = 1600 * (1.1)^5 ≈ 2480.96 yuan

3. (Coupon_rate, Future_value)

- Coupon rate formula: Coupon rate = (Annual coupon payment / Face value) * 100
  - Annual coupon payment = Face value * Coupon rate
  - Coupon rate = 0.12
  - Annual coupon payment = 1000 * 0.12 = 120 yuan

4. (Present_Value, Discount_rate)

- Present Value of an Annuity Due (PVAD) formula: PVAD = FV / (1 + r)^n - r * PVAD
  - FV = Face value + (Annual coupon payment * Number of years)
  - FV = 1000 + (120 * 5) = 1000 + 600 = 1600 yuan
  - PVAD = 1600 / (1 + 0.1)^5 - 0.1 * PVAD
  - PVAD ≈ 1600 / 1.61051 - 0.1 * PVAD ≈ 1600 / 1.61051 - 0.161051 * PVAD
  - PVAD ≈ 1600 / 1.61051 - 0.161051 * PVAD ≈ 992.59 yuan

Based on the calculations above, the present value of the 5-year government bond is approximately 992.59 yuan.

Note:
The content within the three backticks is crucial. Please extract the formulas/equations, ensuring no formulas/equations are missed. Please strictly enumerate following the format "eq1": "T = N * B", "eq2": "R = 0 - T". Just list the original formulas/equations, and do not derive any formulas/equations.
Your answer must strictly conform to the JSON structure outlined in the template. Explicitly avoid using any specific numerical values for the derivation and calculation. There must be no redundant information other than the output in JSON format.
