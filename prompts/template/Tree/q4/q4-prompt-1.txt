Below is a question about financial calculation.
Question: Company B currently meets its funding needs entirely through equity capital, with a cost of equity capital of 0.12. The company now plans to issue bonds at an interest rate of 0.08. In the new capital structure, the market value of the bonds will represent 0.45 of the company's value. If the corporate tax rate is 0.25, calculate the new cost of equity capital and the weighted average cost of capital for the company.

Please only list Target Variable(s) and define its variable name based on the financial terminology, ensuring that each variable name accurately reflects the financial concept it represents. Use underscores to connect words within each variable name. For example, if the financial term is 'Interest Rate', then the variable name should be 'Interest_rate'. Please remember these 'Target Variable(s)', later we will use them. Instruction: Clearly identify the final variable(s) that the calculation seeks to resolve. These Target Variables represent the end goal of the calculation process and are derived from the combination of input and intermediate variables. Defining the target variables sets a clear objective for what the calculation will ascertain. Do not to engage in any form of calculation. Note that only list Target Variable(s). There must be no redundant information other than the Target Variable(s).

Extract units for the Target Variable(s).

Provide a general financial interpretation for the variable(s) according to the general Finance domain or Finance industry common practice. Let's call it 'General Financial Interpretation'.

Based on the context of the specific question, provide a specific interpretation for the variable(s) in the context of our specific question. Let's call it 'Specific Interpretation'.

Present the variable names, units, General Financial Interpretation, Specific Interpretation in structured format in list form.

If the corporate tax rate is 0.25, calculate the new cost of equity capital and the weighted average cost of capital for the company.

Identify all the numerical values in the question, including implicit numerical values such as "three-month," "three months," "five-inch," "five inches," etc. And convert "1 million" or "one million" into 1,000,000, etc. However, do not include numerical values that require derivation and calculation. In the following, we will assign variable names to these numerical values. Please remember these variables as "Input Variable(s)" as a whole, later we will refer to these "Input Variable(s)".

For each numerical value identified above, perform the following tasks:
1. In accordance with the context of the question and following financial industry conventions, for this numerical value, create a new variable and define its variable name based on the financial terminology, ensuring that each variable name accurately reflects the financial concept it represents. Use underscores to connect words within each variable name. For example, if the financial term is 'Interest Rate', then the variable name should be 'Interest_rate'.
2. Assign the numerical value(note:only numbers, no formulas or equations or other variables) to this variable.
3. Provide a general financial interpretation for the variable(s) according to the general Finance domain or Finance industry common practice. Lets call it 'General Financial Interpretation'.
4. Based on the context of the specific question, provide a specific interpretation for the variable(s) in the context of our specific question. Lets call it 'Specific Interpretation'.

-------------------------------------------
```[Question]
Question: There is a 5-year government bond with a face value of 1000 yuan, an annual coupon rate of 0.12. And the interests are compounded(using the annual coupon rate 0.12) annually but not physically paid out to the investor until maturity. Instead, these interests are accrued and recorded and added to the previous compounding basis to form the new basis for compounding(using the annual coupon rate 0.12 to compound) the next year. That's to say, in year 0, the compounding basis is 1000 yuan, then in year 1, the compounding basis becomes 1000*(1+0.12)^1 yuan, in year 2, the compounding basis becomes 1000*(1+0.12)^2 yuan, ... so on and so forth. Then all the accrued interests are paid out at maturity in a lump-sum payment, together with the repayment of the principal. That's to say, both the principal and accrued interests are physically paid out to the investor in a single lump-sum payment at maturity. Assuming an annual discount rate of 0.1, what is its present value?
