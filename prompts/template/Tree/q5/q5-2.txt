Below is a question about financial calculation.
Question: Jindi Company's 2015 income statement shows sales revenue of 8 million yuan, with net profit being 8% of sales revenue. The balance sheet shows current assets of 2 million yuan, fixed assets of 6 million yuan, net working capital of 1 million yuan, and long-term liabilities of 3 million yuan. Please calculate the Return on Equity (ROE). Please do not use the DuPont formula.

Please only list Target Variable(s) and use abbreviations to represent each variable. Please remember these Target Variable(s), later we will use them. Instruction: Clearly identify the final variable(s) that the calculation seeks to resolve. These target variables represent the end goal of the calculation process and are derived from the combination of input and intermediate variables. Defining the target variables sets a clear objective for what the calculation will ascertain. Do not to engage in any form of calculation. Note that only list target variable(s). There must be no redundant information other than the target variable(s).


###2
Identify all the numerical values in the question, including implicit numerical values such as "three-month," "three months," "five-inch," "five inches," etc. And convert "1 million" or "one million" into 1,000,000, etc. However, do not include numerical values that require derivation and calculation. In the following, we will assign variable names to these numerical values. Please remember these variables as "Input Variable(s)" as a whole, later we will refer to these "Input Variable(s)".
For each numerical value identified above, perform the following tasks:
1. In accordance with the context of the question and following financial industry conventions, for this numerical value, create a new variable and define its variable name in an English abbreviation form that conforms to financial industry standards.
2. Assign the numerical value(note:only numbers, no formulas or equations or other variables) to this variable.
3. Based on the context of the question, provide a financial interpretation for this variable.
4. Extract the unit of the numerical value.
5. Present the financial interpretation, variable name, unit, and numerical value in a structured format in list form.



###3
You are a finance expert. Do the following tasks:
Identify variables in the Target Variable(s) and the Input Variable(s) listed above (note: ensure that no variable is omitted). For each variable identified, please perform the following operations:
1. List all formulas/equations in the finance domain that involve this variable (note: list all formulas/equations involving this variable. If a variable does not involve any formulas/equations, do not list it arbitrarily).
2. According to our specific question, apply the above-listed formulas/equations to our specific question. Create necessary but non-overlapping Intermediate Variable(s) (note: Intermediate Variables cannot overlap with Target Variable(s) or Input Variable(s)) as required by the question.


###4
You are a finance expert. Do the following tasks:
Identify variables in the Target Variable(s) and the Input Variable(s) listed above (note: ensure that no variable is omitted). For every two variables identified, please perform the following operations:
List all formulas/equations involving these two variables in the financial field. (Note: List all formulas/equations involving these two variables. If there are no formulas/equations involved between these two variables, please do not list them randomly).
2. According to our specific question, apply the above-listed formulas/equations to our specific question. Create necessary but non-overlapping Intermediate Variable(s) (note: Intermediate Variables cannot overlap with Target Variable(s) or Input Variable(s)) as required by the question.
