<|im_start|> user:
In the formula you had provided previously "SE=TA-TL", you also provided "TA=CA+FA+SE", the two formulas contradict to each other. Please correct!<|im_end|>

##### Answer #####:

You are correct. I apologize for the oversight. The correct formula for Shareholders' Equity (SE) is:

SE = TA - CL - LTL

This formula takes into account the Total Assets (TA), Current Liabilities (CL), and Long-Term Liabilities (LTL) to calculate the Shareholders' Equity (SE).
