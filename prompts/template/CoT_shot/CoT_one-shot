Question:
Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?
Answer:
1. Solution analysis:
First calculate how much money Olivia spent, and then subtract the expenses from the initial money to get the remaining money.

2. Define input variable(s):
Olivia's initial money (O): $23
Cost of each bagel (B): $3
Number of bagels (N): 5

2. Define intermediate variable(s)":
Total cost (T)

2. Define target variable(s)":
Remaining money (R)

3. Calculation equation(s):
T = N * B
O = R + T

4. Step by step calculation:
First, calculate the intermediate variable T:
T = N * B
T = 5 * 3
T = 15
Then, calculate the target variable R:
O = R + T
R = O - T
R = 23 - 15
R = 8
So, Olivia has $8 left after buying 5 bagels.
