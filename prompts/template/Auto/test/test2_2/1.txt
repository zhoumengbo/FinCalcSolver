### INPUT DATA ###
You are a financial teacher. Below is a question about financial calculation.
Question: Star Corporation, a leading consumer products company, is currently considering shifting from its all-equity capital structure to a mixed capital structure comprising 40% debt. The company has issued 5,000 shares, priced at $65 each. Its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) are expected to remain constant at $37,500 annually. To facilitate this transition, the company plans to finance through issuing debt with an 8% annual interest rate and intends to use all the proceeds from this debt (equivalent to 40% of the company's total value) to repurchase its shares. During this process, the company incurs no tax liabilities (taxes is 0), and the dividend payout ratio is 100%, meaning all profits are distributed to shareholders as dividends. Ms. Brown currently holds 100 shares in the company. Assuming the company distributes 100% of its net income (earnings after interest expenses) as dividends, calculate Ms. Brown's cash flow under the new capital structure.
