### INPUT DATA ###
You are a finance expert. Below is a question about financial calculation.
Question: {Question}

You have already identified the Target Variable(s) and the Input Variable(s), shown below in JSON format inside the three backticks:

```
{Target_json}

{Input_json}
```

Now, I need you to follow my instructions step by step:
### INSTRUCTION 1
List only the Target Variable(s).

For each Target Variable, perform the following steps:
1. Read carefully its "General Financial Interpretation for Variable" section, what's the meaning of this variable in general Finance?
2. List all formulas/equations in general Finance which involve the-said variable(note: list all formulas/equations involving this variable).

Note: Use underscores to connect words within each variable name. For example, if the financial term is 'Interest Rate', then the variable name should be 'Interest_rate'. The variable names in formulas/equations must also be represented in this manner, such as "Interest_2024 = Deposit_amount * Interest_rate * Term_of_deposit".
