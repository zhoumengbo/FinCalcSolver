### INSTRUCTION ###
Carefully evaluate each solution's approach to the problem, with a keen focus on how they utilize the predefined variables and information provided in the question. Pay particular attention to whether the solutions appropriately apply the specific information given, especially in terms of numerical data. If the question lacks necessary numerical information, consider solutions that do not rely on such data for computation. Assess their methodologies, focusing on the effectiveness of using available information to solve the problem. Conclude by determining which solution is more effective, providing reasoned justification based on their use of the given information and adherence to the problem's requirements.
