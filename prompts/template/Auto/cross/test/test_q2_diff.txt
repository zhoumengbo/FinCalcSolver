### INPUT DATA ###
Below is a question about financial calculation.
Question: There is a 5 years government bond with a face value of 1000 yuan, an annual coupon rate of 0.12. And the interests are compounded annually but not physically paid out to the investor until maturity. Instead, these interests are accrued and recorded and added to the compounding basis to become the new basis for compounding next year. Then all the accrued interests are paid out at maturity in a lump-sum payment, together with the repayment of the principal. That's to say, both the principal and accrued interests are physically paid out to the investor in a single lump-sum payment at maturity. Assume an annual discount rate of 0.1. What is the bond's present value?

I have already defined all the Variable(s) inside the three backticks and provided you with some solutions inside @@@.

Solution A:
	Calculate Bond_present_value
	Formula/equation: Bond_present_value = (Face_value * (1 + Annual_coupon_rate)**Number_of_years) / (1 + Annual_discount_rate)**Number_of_years
		Face_value: 1000
		Annual_coupon_rate: 0.12
		Number_of_years: 5
		Annual_discount_rate: 0.1

Solution B:
	Calculate Bond_present_value
	Formula/equation: Accrued_interest = Future_value_of_principal - Bond_present_value

	Calculate Accrued_interest
	Formula/equation: Total_payment_at_maturity = Future_value_of_principal + Accrued_interest
		Total_payment_at_maturity: None

	Calculate Future_value_of_principal
	Formula/equation: Future_value_of_principal = Face_value * (1 + Annual_coupon_rate)**Number_of_years
		Face_value: 1000
		Annual_coupon_rate: 0.12
		Number_of_years: 5

	Calculate Future_value_of_principal
	Formula/equation: Future_value_of_principal = Face_value * (1 + Annual_coupon_rate)**Number_of_years
		Face_value: 1000
		Annual_coupon_rate: 0.12
		Number_of_years: 5
