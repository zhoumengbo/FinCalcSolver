### TASK ###
Your task involves evaluating multiple financial solutions. Begin by carefully reading the Question and the already defined Variable(s). Then, refer to the provided 'Evaluation Criteria' and 'Scoring Justification' sections to guide your assessment. Each solution should be scored based on these criteria, with detailed reasons for the scores given. Additionally, to avoid overly concentrated scoring, provide specific and differentiated evaluations for different aspects of each solution.

#### Evaluation Criteria ####
1. Utilization of Question Information (total 50 points): Ensure that all the information provided in the question are utilized in the solution. Carefully compare the variables used in the solution with the Input Variable(s) defined in the preceding JSON format.
2. Formula Accuracy (total 50 points): Examine if the formulas used in the solution are correct and applicable to the given financial context.

#### Scoring Justification ####
1. Scores should reflect the solution's performance in each criterion.
2. Award full points when a solution completely satisfies a criterion.
3. When deducting points, provide a clear justification. For minor errors, a deduction of 5-10 points might be appropriate, while major errors could lead to more significant deductions or zero points for that criterion.
4. Highlight the unique characteristics and performance of each solution to emphasize the distinctions between them.

Output your answer in JSON format, with the format as follows:
