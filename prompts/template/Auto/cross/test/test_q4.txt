### INPUT DATA ###
Below is a question about financial calculation.
Question: Company B currently meets its funding needs entirely through equity capital, with a cost of equity capital of 0.12. The company now plans to issue bonds at an interest rate of 0.08. In the new capital structure, the market value of the bonds will represent 0.45 of the company's value. If the corporate tax rate is 0.25, calculate the new cost of equity capital and the weighted average cost of capital for the company.

I have already defined all the Variable(s) inside the three backticks and provided you with some formula(s)/equation(s) inside @@@.
