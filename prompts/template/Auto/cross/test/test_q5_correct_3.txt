### INPUT DATA ###
Below is a question about financial calculation.
Question: Jindi Company's 2015 income statement shows sales revenue of 8 million yuan, with net profit being 8% of sales revenue. The balance sheet shows current assets of 2 million yuan, fixed assets of 6 million yuan, net working capital of 1 million yuan, and long-term liabilities of 3 million yuan. Please calculate the Return on Equity (ROE). Please do not use the DuPont formula.

We have already extracted the Target Variable(s) and Input Variable(s) inside the three backticks.

### INSTRUCTION ###
Below is a student's solution. I will provide a calculation step each time. Please, in the context of the question, carefully check the correctness of each step, point out any errors, and provide the correct formulas along with explanations.

Step 1: To calculate the "ROE", we use the formula "ROE = Net_income / Shareholders_equity", where "Net_income" is "The amount of money a company has left after paying for all its expenses and taxes."(unknown), "Shareholders_equity" is "The residual interest in the assets of a company after deducting all its liabilities."(unknown).
Step 2: To calculate the "Net_income", we use the formula "Net_profit = Net_income", where "Net_profit" is "The amount of money a company has left after paying for all its expenses and taxes."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 640000 Yuan).
Step 3: To calculate the "Shareholders_equity", we use the formula "Shareholders_equity = Total_assets - Total_liabilities", where "Total_assets" is "The sum of all a company's assets, including current assets and fixed assets."(unknown), "Total_liabilities" is "The sum of all a company's liabilities, including current liabilities and long-term liabilities."(unknown).
Step 4: To calculate the "Total_assets", we use the formula "Total_assets = Current_assets + Fixed_assets + Other_assets", where "Current_assets" is "Assets that are expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or the company's operating cycle, whichever is longer."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 2000000 Yuan), "Fixed_assets" is "Assets that are expected to be used by a company for more than one year, such as buildings, machinery, and equipment."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 6000000 Yuan), "Other_assets" is "Assets that are not classified as current assets or fixed assets."(unknown).
Step 5: To calculate the "Other_assets", we use the formula "Other_assets = Other_assets_expense", where "Other_assets_expense" is "unknown"(unknown).
Step 6: To calculate the "Total_liabilities", we use the formula "Total_liabilities = Current_liabilities + Long_term_liabilities", where "Current_liabilities" is "Debts or obligations that a company expects to pay within one year."(unknown), "Long_term_liabilities" is "Debts or obligations that a company expects to pay within more than one year."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 3000000 Yuan).
Step 7: To calculate the "Current_liabilities", we use the formula "Net_working_capital = Current_assets - Current_liabilities", where "Net_working_capital" is "The difference between a company's current assets and its current liabilities."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 1000000 Yuan), "Current_assets" is "Assets that are expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or the company's operating cycle, whichever is longer."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 2000000 Yuan).

Below are the results of symbolic calculations based on the steps provided by the student. Some values could not be solved, which may give you some insightsï¼š
[{Current_liabilities: 1000000, Net_income: 640000, Other_assets: Total_assets - 8000000, Other_assets_expense: Total_assets - 8000000, ROE: 640000/(Total_assets - 4000000), Shareholders_equity: Total_assets - 4000000, Total_liabilities: 4000000}]
