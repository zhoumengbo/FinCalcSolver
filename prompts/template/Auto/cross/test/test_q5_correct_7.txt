### INPUT DATA ###
Below is a question about financial calculation.
Question: Jindi Company's 2015 income statement shows sales revenue of 8 million yuan, with net profit being 8% of sales revenue. The balance sheet shows current assets of 2 million yuan, fixed assets of 6 million yuan, net working capital of 1 million yuan, and long-term liabilities of 3 million yuan.

Step 4: To calculate the "Total_assets", we use the formula "Total_assets = Current_assets + Fixed_assets + Other_assets", where "Current_assets" is "Assets that are expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or the company's operating cycle, whichever is longer."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 2000000 Yuan), "Fixed_assets" is "Assets that are expected to be used by a company for more than one year, such as buildings, machinery, and equipment."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 6000000 Yuan), "Other_assets" is "Assets that are not classified as current assets or fixed assets."(unknown).
