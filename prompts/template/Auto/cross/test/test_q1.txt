### INPUT DATA ###
Below is a question about financial calculation.
Question: To stimulate economic growth, since 2022, the country has repeatedly lowered bank deposit interest rates. The three-year rate was 0.0315 in August 2022, reduced to 0.03 in October, and further to 0.0285 in January 2023. These rates are simple annual interest rates. In January 2023, if Mr. Wang has a deposit of $100,000 for a fixed term of three years (note that this is a fixed-term deposit for three years), how much less interest will he earn compared to a similar three-year term deposit that if he had started in August 2022? Please use simple interest in your calculations, and do not use exponential or continuous compounding.

I have already defined all the Variable(s) inside the three backticks and provided you with some solutions inside @@@.

Solution 1:
	Step: Calculate Interest_difference
	Formula/equation: Interest_difference = Interest_2023 - Interest_2022

	Step: Calculate Interest_2023
	Formula/equation: Interest_2023 = Deposit_amount * Interest_rate_January_2023 * Term_of_deposit
		Deposit_amount: 100000
		Interest_rate_January_2023: 0.0285
		Term_of_deposit: 3

	Step: Calculate Interest_2022
	Formula/equation: Interest_2022 = Deposit_amount * Interest_rate_August_2022 * Term_of_deposit
		Deposit_amount: 100000
		Interest_rate_August_2022: 0.0315
		Term_of_deposit: 3
