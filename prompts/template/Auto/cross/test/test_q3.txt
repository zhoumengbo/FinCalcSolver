### INPUT DATA ###
Below is a question about financial calculation.
Question: Company A's common stock has shown little change in trading price over the past month, and investors are confident that there will be significant price movement in three months, but they are uncertain whether it will rise or fall. The current stock price is 100 yuan per share, and the price of a three-month call option with a strike price of 100 yuan is 10 yuan (it is expected that the stock will not pay dividends). If the risk-free effective annual interest rate is 0.1, what is the price of a three-month put option on Company A's stock? Please calculate using exponential continuous compounding, i.e., use exponential form for continuous compounding of 0.1.

I have already defined all the Variable(s) inside the three backticks and provided you with some formula(s)/equation(s) inside @@@.

### INSTRUCTION ###
1. Carefully read the Question and already defined Variable(s) inside the three backticks, and consider thoroughly, comprehensively, and patiently how to solve the Question.
2. Select some formula(s)/equation(s) inside @@@ that you believe are correct and appropriate. You need to consider the meaning of the variables in these formulas within the context of the problem, and identify which of these correspond to Variables already defined inside the three backticks.
3. Solve the problem step by step. Please note that some formulas may be directly related and need to be solved jointly. Or, you may need to find a more suitable calculation formula for this problem.
