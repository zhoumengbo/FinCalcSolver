### INSTRUCTION ###
Below is a student's solution, which includes several steps and calculation formulas. Please check the correctness of each step one by one, point out any errors, and provide the correct formulas along with explanations.

Step 1: To calculate the "ROE", we use the formula "ROE = Net_income / Shareholders_equity", where "Net_income" is "The amount of money a company has left after paying for all its expenses and taxes."(unknown), "Shareholders_equity" is "The residual interest in the assets of a company after deducting all its liabilities."(unknown).
Step 2: To calculate the "Net_income", we use the formula "Net_profit = Net_income", where "Net_profit" is "The amount of money a company has left after paying for all its expenses and taxes."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 640000 Yuan).
Step 3: To calculate the "Shareholders_equity", we use the formula "Shareholders_equity = Total_assets - Total_liabilities", where "Total_assets" is "The sum of all a company's assets, including current assets and fixed assets."(unknown), "Total_liabilities" is "The sum of all a company's liabilities, including current liabilities and long-term liabilities."(unknown).
Step 4: To calculate the "Total_assets", we use the formula "Total_assets = Current_assets + Fixed_assets + Other_assets", where "Current_assets" is "Assets that are expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or the company's operating cycle, whichever is longer."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 2000000 Yuan), "Fixed_assets" is "Assets that are expected to be used by a company for more than one year, such as buildings, machinery, and equipment."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 6000000 Yuan), "Other_assets" is "Assets that are not classified as current assets or fixed assets."(unknown).
Step 5: To calculate the "Other_assets", we use the formula "Other_assets = Other_assets_expense", where "Other_assets_expense" is "unknown"(unknown).
Step 6: To calculate the "Total_liabilities", we use the formula "Total_liabilities = Current_liabilities + Long_term_liabilities", where "Current_liabilities" is "Debts or obligations that a company expects to pay within one year."(unknown), "Long_term_liabilities" is "Debts or obligations that a company expects to pay within more than one year."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 3000000 Yuan).
Step 7: To calculate the "Current_liabilities", we use the formula "Net_working_capital = Current_assets - Current_liabilities", where "Net_working_capital" is "The difference between a company's current assets and its current liabilities."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 1000000 Yuan), "Current_assets" is "Assets that are expected to be converted into cash or used up within one year or the company's operating cycle, whichever is longer."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 2000000 Yuan).<|im_end|>

 The student's solution has several errors and omissions. Here is the corrected solution:

Step 1: To calculate the "ROE", we use the formula "ROE = Net_profit / Shareholders_equity", where "Net_profit" is "The amount of money a company has left after paying for all its expenses and taxes."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 640000 Yuan), "Shareholders_equity" is "The residual interest in the assets of a company after deducting all its liabilities."(unknown, but we can calculate it).

Step 2: To calculate the "Shareholders_equity", we use the formula "Shareholders_equity = Total_assets - Total_liabilities", where "Total_assets" is "The sum of all a company's assets, including current assets and fixed assets."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 2000000 Yuan + 6000000 Yuan = 8000000 Yuan), "Total_liabilities" is "The sum of all a company's liabilities, including current liabilities and long-term liabilities."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 3000000 Yuan).

Step 3: To calculate the "ROE", we use the formula "ROE = Net_profit / Shareholders_equity", where "Net_profit" is "The amount of money a company has left after paying for all its expenses and taxes."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 640000 Yuan), "Shareholders_equity" is "The residual interest in the assets of a company after deducting all its liabilities."(calculated, it is 8000000 Yuan - 3000000 Yuan = 5000000 Yuan).

Step 4: To calculate the "ROE", we use the formula "ROE = Net_profit / Shareholders_equity", where "Net_profit" is "The amount of money a company has left after paying for all its expenses and taxes."(known, it is the input variable, the value is given as 640000 Yuan), "Shareholders_equity" is "The residual interest in the assets of a company after deducting all its liabilities."(calculated, it is 8000000 Yuan - 3000000 Yuan = 5000000 Yuan).

The ROE for Jindi Company in 2015 is 12.8% (640000 Yuan / 5000000 Yuan = 0.128).<|im_end|>

##### Answer #####:

 Here is the summary of the analysis and evaluation, along with the correct formulas in JSON format:

```json
{
  "formula1": "ROE = Net_profit / Shareholders_equity",
  "formula2": "Shareholders_equity = Total_assets - Total_liabilities",
  "formula3": "Total_assets = Current_assets + Fixed_assets",
  "formula4": "Total_liabilities = Current_liabilities + Long_term_liabilities",
  "formula5": "Net_working_capital = Current_assets - Current_liabilities"
}
```

The corrected formulas for calculating ROE and Shareholders' equity are:

1. ROE = Net_profit / Shareholders_equity
2. Shareholders_equity = Total_assets - Total_liabilities
3. Total_assets = Current_assets + Fixed_assets
4. Total_liabilities = Current_liabilities + Long_term_liabilities
5. Net_working_capital = Current_assets - Current_liabilities

The ROE for Jindi Company in 2015 is 12.8% (640000 Yuan / 5000000 Yuan = 0.128).
