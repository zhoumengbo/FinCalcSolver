When evaluating each solution's approach to the problem, critically analyze how they utilize the predefined variables and the information provided in the question. Emphasize the necessity of recognizing when crucial numerical data or specific variables are missing. Assess the suitability of each solution in such scenarios, favoring approaches that adapt to the absence of certain numerical information. Evaluate the methodologies with an eye for their adaptability and effectiveness in leveraging the information actually available, rather than assuming the presence of all necessary data. Conclude by identifying the most effective solution, providing a reasoned justification based on its adaptability to the information constraints and adherence to the problem's core requirements.
