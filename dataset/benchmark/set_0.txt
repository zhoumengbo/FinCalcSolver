-900###To stimulate economic growth, since 2022, the country has repeatedly lowered bank deposit interest rates. The three-year rate was 3.15% in August 2022, reduced to 3.00% in October, and further to 2.85% in January 2023. These rates are simple annual interest rates. In January 2023, if Mr. Wang has a deposit of $100,000 for a fixed term of three years (note that this is a fixed-term deposit for three years), how much less interest will he earn compared to a similar three-year term deposit that if he had started in August 2022? Please use simple interest in your calculations, and do not use exponential or continuous compounding.
1094.2755###There is a 5 years government bond with a face value of 1000 yuan, an annual coupon rate of 12%. And the interests are compounded annually but not physically paid out to the investor until maturity. Instead, these interests are accrued and recorded and added to the compounding basis to become the new basis for compounding next year. Then all the accrued interests are paid out at maturity in a lump-sum payment, together with the repayment of the principal. That's to say, both the principal and accrued interests are physically paid out to the investor in a single lump-sum payment at maturity. Assume an annual discount rate of 10%. What is the bond's present value?
7.531###Company A's common stock has shown little change in trading price over the past month, and investors are confident that there will be significant price movement in three months, but they are uncertain whether it will rise or fall. The current stock price is 100 yuan per share, and the price of a three-month call option with a strike price of 100 yuan is 10 yuan (it is expected that the stock will not pay dividends). If the risk-free effective annual interest rate is 10%, what is the price of a three-month put option on Company A's stock? Please calculate using exponential continuous compounding, i.e., use exponential form for continuous compounding of 10%.
0.1445###0.1065###Company B currently meets its funding needs entirely through equity capital, with a cost of equity capital of 12%. The company now plans to issue bonds at an interest rate of 8%. In the new capital structure, the market value of the bonds will represent 45% of the company's value. If the corporate tax rate is 25%, calculate the new cost of equity capital and the weighted average cost of capital for the company.

12.5###Company A produces only one product and is currently in profitable status. The initial unit variable cost is 10 yuan, and the sensitivity coefficient of earnings before interest and taxes to variable costs is -4. The sensitivity of the company's earnings to cost variations is measured by the sensitivity coefficient of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to variable costs. If Company A wants to reach the profit break-even point, what should the unit variable cost be adjusted to?
