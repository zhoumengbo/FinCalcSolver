If not sold, the old machine will require maintenance costs of $520,000 at the end of the year for the next 5 years. Depreciation on the old machine is $240,000 per year. At the end of 5 years, it will have a salvage value of $200,000 and a book value of $0. If a new machine were purchased now, it would cost $3 million and would require maintenance costs of $350,000 at the end of each year during its economic life of 5 years. At the end of the 5 years, the new machine will have a salvage value of $500,000. It will be fully depreciated by the straight-line method. The price of the new machine in five years will be $3,500,000. Regardless of the decision made today, Pilot will have to purchase the new machine in five years. The corporate tax rate is 0.34 and the appropriate discount rate is 0.12. The company is assumed to earn sufficient revenues to generate tax shields from depreciation. (a) Calculate the net present value of keeping the old machine for 5 more years. (b) Calculate the net present value of buying the new machine now and replacing it after 5 years. (c) Calculate the difference in Net Present Value between keeping the old machine for 5 more years and buying the new machine now.
1113.99###1111.08###When assessing an opportunity in the bond market, you are faced with three different types of bonds, each with a face value of $1,000. First, there is a One-Year Zero-Coupon Bond, which has a yield to maturity of 5%, does not pay any interest annually, and is redeemed at its face value after one year. Next, you have a Two-Year Zero-Coupon Bond offering a yield to maturity of 6%, with no annual interest payments, redeemed at face value at the end of two years. Lastly, there is a Two-Year Coupon Bond with a 12% annual coupon rate and a yield to maturity of 5.8%, where the interest is paid annually. Present value calculation is the process of discounting future income streams at a specific yield rate. Based on the above information, your task is to calculate the present value of the Two-Year Coupon Bond and the present value when you "strip" this bond. ("Stripping" refers to breaking down the bond into its component zero-coupon bonds, one representing the first year's coupon payment and another representing the second year's coupon payment plus principal.)

The flotation cost for new equity is 8%, but the flotation cost for debt is only 5%. Your boss has decided to fund the project by borrowing money because the flotation costs are lower and the needed funds are relatively small.

(b) What is the true cost of building the new assembly line after taking flotation costs into account?
9800###Alpha Corporation and Beta Corporation are identical in every way except their capital structures. Alpha Corporation, an all-equity firm, has 10,000 shares of stock outstanding, currently worth $20 per share. Beta Corporation uses leverage in its capital structure. The market value of Beta's debt is 50,000, and its cost of debt is 12%. Each firm is expected to have earnings before the interest of $55,000 in perpetuity. Neither firm pays taxes. Assume that every investor can borrow at 12% per year. Now an investor wants to purchase 20% stake of Alpha Company. Construct an investment strategy that allows investors to replicate the cost and absolute return of purchasing 20% of Beta's equity through Alpha's 20% equity. Calculate the return of this investment strategy.
903###Star Corporation, a leading consumer products company, is currently considering shifting from its all-equity capital structure to a mixed capital structure comprising 40% debt. The company has issued 5,000 shares, priced at $65 each. Its Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) are expected to remain constant at $37,500 annually. To facilitate this transition, the company plans to finance through issuing debt with an 8% annual interest rate and intends to use all the proceeds from this debt (equivalent to 40% of the company's total value) to repurchase its shares. During this process, the company incurs no tax liabilities (taxes is 0), and the dividend payout ratio is 100%, meaning all profits are distributed to shareholders as dividends. Ms. Brown currently holds 100 shares in the company. Assuming the company distributes 100% of its net income (earnings after interest expenses) as dividends, calculate Ms. Brown's cash flow under the new capital structure.

You anticipate that one year from now, the yields will have shifted to: A 1-year bond with a yield to maturity of 5%; A 2-year bond with a yield to maturity of 6%; A 3-year bond with a yield to maturity of 7%. With this information, you are tasked to calculate the following:  (a) If you buy a 3-year zero-coupon bond now, what is your expected holding period yield next year? (b) Under the expectations theory, what yields to maturity does the market expect to observe on 1-year and 2-year zero-coupon bonds in the next year?
